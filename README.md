# MISP-Wazuh Integration: Complete SOC Implementation Guide

## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for integrating MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) with Wazuh Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. I successfully implemented this integration to create an advanced threat intelligence-enabled SOC system that automatically enriches security alerts with threat context. This setup enables security teams to correlate security events with threat intelligence indicators, providing immediate context for faster incident response and threat hunting activities.

## Architecture

### Final SOC Infrastructure
```
Ubuntu Server (192.168.64.17)     ←     Parrot OS (192.168.64.11)
├── Wazuh Manager                        └── Wazuh Agent + Suricata IDS
├── Wazuh Dashboard (:443)
├── MISP Platform (:8443)
└── Integration Scripts
```

### Key Components
- **Network Monitoring**: Suricata IDS with 44,000+ detection rules for comprehensive network traffic analysis
- **SIEM Platform**: Wazuh for centralized security event management and log correlation
- **Threat Intelligence**: MISP with automated IOC correlation against global threat databases
- **Integration Layer**: Custom Python scripts for real-time threat enrichment and alert enhancement

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server with Wazuh Manager installed and operational
- Existing Wazuh-Suricata integration configured for network monitoring
- Network connectivity between all components in the 192.168.64.x subnet
- Administrative access to Ubuntu server with sudo privileges

## Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Docker Environment Setup

#### 1.1 Install Docker and Dependencies
Docker provides containerization for MISP deployment, ensuring consistent environment and easy management. The installation includes Docker Engine, Docker Compose, and Git for repository management.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose git -y
```

#### 1.2 Install Docker Compose V2
Ubuntu's default Docker Compose version lacks support for newer container features required by MISP. This command downloads the latest stable release directly from GitHub to ensure compatibility.
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

#### 1.3 Create Symbolic Link
Creating a symbolic link allows the system to find Docker Compose regardless of the installation method. This ensures compatibility with MISP's Docker setup scripts.
```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
```

#### 1.4 Configure Docker Permissions
Adding the current user to the Docker group eliminates the need for sudo with Docker commands. The newgrp command activates the group membership immediately without requiring logout.
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

#### 1.5 Verify Installation
Confirming the Docker Compose version ensures the installation was successful and the required features are available.
```bash
docker-compose --version
```

### Phase 2: MISP Platform Deployment

#### 2.1 Clone MISP Docker Repository
The official MISP Docker repository contains pre-configured containers and orchestration files. Cloning this repository provides access to production-ready MISP deployment configurations.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MISP/misp-docker.git && cd misp-docker
```

#### 2.2 Configure Environment
The template environment file contains default configuration values for MISP services. Copying it to .env creates the active configuration file that Docker Compose will use during deployment.
```bash
cp template.env .env && ls -la
```

#### 2.3 Verify Server IP Address
Confirming the server's IP address ensures proper network configuration for MISP services. This IP will be used for accessing the MISP web interface and API endpoints.
```bash
hostname -I
```

#### 2.4 Download MISP Container Images
Pulling container images downloads all required MISP components including the core application, database, Redis cache, and supporting services. This process may take several minutes depending on network speed.
```bash
docker-compose pull
```

#### 2.5 Resolve Port Conflicts
Since Wazuh occupies port 443, MISP must be configured to use an alternative port to avoid binding conflicts. This modification changes the external port mapping while preserving internal SSL configuration.
```bash
sed -i 's/443:443/8443:443/g' docker-compose.yml
```

#### 2.6 Deploy MISP Platform
The detached mode (-d) flag starts all MISP containers in the background, allowing continued terminal access. This command orchestrates the entire MISP stack including database initialization and service dependencies.
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 2.7 Verify Container Status
Checking container status confirms successful deployment and identifies any services that failed to start properly. All containers should show "Up" status for a healthy deployment.
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### Phase 3: MISP Configuration and Setup

#### 3.1 Access MISP Web Interface
The MISP web interface provides administrative access for platform configuration and threat intelligence management. Accept the self-signed certificate warning as this is expected for local deployments.
Navigate to: `https://192.168.64.17:8443`

**Default Credentials:**
- Username: `admin@admin.test`
- Password: `admin`

#### 3.2 Enable MISP Platform
MISP includes safety mechanisms that disable certain features by default. Enabling the live setting activates all platform features including API access, event correlation, and automated processing capabilities.
1. Navigate to **Administration** → **Server Settings & Maintenance**
2. Click on **MISP (49)** tab
3. Verify `MISP.live` is set to `true`
4. Apply configuration changes

#### 3.3 Generate API Authentication Key
API keys provide secure authentication for programmatic access to MISP services. The read-only permission limits Wazuh to querying threat intelligence without modifying MISP data, following security best practices.
1. Click **Admin** (top right) → **My Profile**
2. Click **Auth keys**
3. Create new API key with settings:
   - **Comment**: "Wazuh Integration"
   - **Read only**: ✅ Enabled
   - **Allowed IPs**: `192.168.64.17`
4. Save the generated API key securely

### Phase 4: Wazuh-MISP Integration Development

#### 4.1 Create Integration Script
Wazuh integration scripts process security alerts and enrich them with external threat intelligence. This Python script extracts IP addresses from alerts and queries MISP for matching threat indicators.
```bash
sudo nano /var/ossec/integrations/custom-misp.py
```

**Integration Script Content:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import json
import requests
import re

# MISP Configuration
MISP_URL = "https://192.168.64.17:8443"
MISP_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

def search_misp(indicator):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': MISP_API_KEY,
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    
    url = f"{MISP_URL}/attributes/restSearch"
    data = {"value": indicator}
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data, verify=False)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            result = response.json()
            if 'response' in result and 'Attribute' in result['response']:
                return result['response']['Attribute']
        return None
    except:
        return None

def main():
    alert = json.loads(sys.stdin.read())
    
    # Extract IP addresses from the alert
    ip_pattern = r'\b(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b'
    text = json.dumps(alert)
    ips = re.findall(ip_pattern, text)
    
    for ip in ips:
        if not ip.startswith('192.168.') and not ip.startswith('127.'):
            result = search_misp(ip)
            if result and len(result) > 0:
                print(json.dumps({
                    "misp": {
                        "found": True,
                        "indicator": ip,
                        "attributes": len(result),
                        "threat_level": "High"
                    }
                }))
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### 4.2 Configure Script Permissions
Proper file permissions ensure the Wazuh service can execute the integration script while maintaining security. The wazuh group ownership allows the service account to access the script without elevated privileges.
```bash
sudo chmod 755 /var/ossec/integrations/custom-misp.py
sudo chown root:wazuh /var/ossec/integrations/custom-misp.py
```

#### 4.3 Configure Wazuh Integration
The ossec.conf file defines which security events trigger the MISP integration script. This configuration targets specific event types that are most likely to contain external IP addresses requiring threat intelligence enrichment.
```bash
sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```

Add the following configuration block before `</ossec_config>`:
```xml
<integration>
  <name>custom-misp</name>
  <group>sysmon_event1,sysmon_event_3,web,attacks</group>
  <alert_format>json</alert_format>
</integration>
```

#### 4.4 Restart Wazuh Manager
Restarting the Wazuh manager loads the new integration configuration and makes the MISP script available for processing security alerts. Status verification ensures the service restarted successfully with the new configuration.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
sudo systemctl status wazuh-manager
```

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation

#### 5.1 Create Test Threat Intelligence
Creating test events allows validation of the integration without relying on external threat data. This controlled approach ensures the integration works correctly before processing real security alerts.
1. In MISP, navigate to **Add Event**
2. Configure event details:
   - **Info**: "Test Malicious IP"
   - **Threat Level**: "High"
   - **Distribution**: "Your organisation only"
   - **Analysis**: "Initial"
3. Submit event

#### 5.2 Add Malicious Indicator
Threat indicators define specific IOCs that MISP will track and correlate against security events. Adding a test IP address creates a known malicious indicator for integration testing purposes.
1. Click **Add Attribute**
2. Configure attribute:
   - **Category**: "Network activity"
   - **Type**: "ip-src"
   - **Value**: "8.8.8.8"
   - **Comment**: "Test malicious IP for Wazuh integration"
3. Submit attribute

#### 5.3 Publish Event
Publishing makes the event and its indicators searchable via the MISP API. Unpublished events remain in draft status and won't appear in API queries, preventing integration testing from succeeding.
1. Navigate to the created event
2. Click **Publish Event**
3. Confirm publication

#### 5.4 Test MISP API Connectivity
Direct API testing verifies that MISP responds correctly to REST queries and returns properly formatted threat intelligence data. This step isolates API functionality from integration script logic.
```bash
curl -k -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" -H "Accept: application/json" "https://192.168.64.17:8443/attributes/restSearch" -X POST -d '{"value":"8.8.8.8"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### 5.5 Test Integration Script
End-to-end testing simulates how Wazuh will invoke the integration script during real security events. I tested this functionality using simulated alert input that mimics an actual security alert containing the test IP address configured in MISP.
```bash
echo '{"srcip":"8.8.8.8","rule":{"id":"1002"},"full_log":"test"}' | sudo -u wazuh python3 /var/ossec/integrations/custom-misp.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{"misp": {"found": true, "indicator": "8.8.8.8", "attributes": 1, "threat_level": "High"}}
```

## Integration Verification

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Docker Compose Version Compatibility
**Problem**: During initial deployment, I encountered Docker installation issues from Ubuntu repositories that included an outdated version not supporting the `start_interval` parameter required by MISP containers.

**Error Message**: 
```
start_interval does not match regex error
```

**Root Cause**: Ubuntu 22.04's default repositories contain Docker Compose v1.x which lacks support for newer container health check features that MISP containers require for proper initialization.

**Solution**: Upgraded to Docker Compose V2 by downloading the latest binary directly from GitHub releases and configuring proper symbolic links for system-wide access.

**Resolution Commands**:
```bash
sudo apt remove docker-compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
```

### Challenge 2: Port Conflict Resolution
**Problem**: Both Wazuh Dashboard and MISP attempted to bind to port 443, causing container startup failures and preventing access to either service.

**Error Message**:
```
Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint
```

**Root Cause**: Default MISP configuration assumes exclusive use of standard HTTPS port 443, conflicting with existing Wazuh Dashboard deployment on the same system.

**Solution**: Modified the Docker Compose configuration to map MISP to external port 8443 while maintaining internal port 443 for SSL termination within containers.

**Resolution Command**:
```bash
sed -i 's/443:443/8443:443/g' docker-compose.yml
```

### Challenge 3: Docker Permission Issues
**Problem**: Standard user account lacked permissions to execute Docker commands, resulting in "permission denied" errors when attempting to manage containers.

**Error Message**:
```
docker: permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket
```

**Root Cause**: Docker daemon requires elevated privileges or group membership to access the Docker socket, which regular user accounts don't have by default for security reasons.

**Solution**: Added the user to the Docker group and activated the new group membership without requiring logout, enabling Docker command execution without sudo.

**Resolution Commands**:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### Challenge 4: MISP API Response Structure
**Problem**: I initially experienced integration script failures when parsing MISP API responses due to incorrect JSON structure assumptions, causing threat intelligence queries to return empty results.

**Issue**: The script expected threat intelligence data directly in the `Attribute` key, but MISP API actually returns data nested under `response.Attribute` with additional metadata wrapper.

**Root Cause**: MISP's REST API response format differs from the expected structure, requiring proper navigation of the nested JSON response to access threat intelligence attributes.

**Solution**: Debugged the API response structure using direct cURL commands and updated the Python script to correctly parse the nested JSON response format.

**Resolution**: Modified the search_misp() function to properly access `result['response']['Attribute']` instead of `result['Attribute']` and added proper error handling for empty responses.

### Challenge 5: MISP Event Publication Requirements
**Problem**: Created threat indicators were not appearing in API search results during testing, causing integration validation to fail despite correct configuration.

**Root Cause**: MISP events must be explicitly published before they become searchable via the REST API, as unpublished events remain in draft status for security and data quality reasons.

**Solution**: Added event publication step to the testing procedure to ensure threat intelligence is accessible for Wazuh integration queries and documented this requirement for future use.

**Process Enhancement**: Incorporated event publication verification into the standard operating procedures for threat intelligence management to prevent similar issues in production.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Expand to include additional threat intelligence feeds (VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, Abuse.ch) for comprehensive threat coverage
- **Automated Response**: Implement automatic blocking of confirmed malicious IPs via firewall integration with pfSense or iptables for active defense
- **Advanced Analytics**: Develop custom correlation rules based on threat intelligence metadata including threat actor attribution and campaign tracking
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching mechanisms for frequently queried indicators to reduce API latency and improve response times

### Maintenance Considerations
